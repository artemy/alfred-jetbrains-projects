## Getting started

### Prerequisites

Project requires Python 3.9+ to run, which is not included by default with macOS. You can install Python 3 using
this [guide](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/).

### Installing

Download `*.alfredworkflow` file for your IDE from the latest release
at [Releases](https://github.com/artemy/alfred-jetbrains-projects/releases) page and open it with Alfred.

### How to Use

Open Alfred and type keyword for your IDE (see Supported IDEs above). Workflow will display list of recent projects (
sorted by time last opened descending).

You can further filter project list by typing additional words. Fuzzy first-letter search is supported (i.e.
typing `map` will find `my-awesome-project`):

```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

To run tests, execute

```shell
python3 -m recent_projects_test
```

If you want to get coverage figures through `coverage` tool:

```shell
coverage run -m unittest recent_projects_test # gather test data
coverage report -m # display coverage figures
```

## Built With

* [Python 3.9](https://docs.python.org/3.9/)
